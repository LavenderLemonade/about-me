# About Me.

Hello there! It's me, LavenderLemonade, aka Sam. Hopefully this will be the first of many repositories as I document my coding journey here on GitHub.

## What to Expect

You'll find me posting repos for each code project I embark on, as there is a lot of stuff I want to do and a lot of languages I want to learn. Hopefully I'll be updating this fairly regularly.

## What Types of Projects?

Doing a lot with React and JS Frameworks right now, trying to get better at them and utilizing unit testing and static analysis and end-to-end testing. Also, I'm working on getting my AWS and Azure certs! :D

## Non-Coding Interests?

When I'm not ruining my eyes staring at a code editor, you'll most likely find me ruining my eyes staring at a YouTube video or a video game. These days you'll also find me painting models of all sizes, from Warhammer to Gunpla, collecting and playing board games, reading fantasy and sci-fi novels, collecting manga, cooking korean dishes, and just trying to do too much at once.

### What've I cooked most recently?

Gyudon. I be doing that a lot.
