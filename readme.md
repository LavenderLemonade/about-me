# About Me.

Hello there! It's me, LavenderLemonade, aka Sam. Hopefully this will be the first of many repositories as I document my coding journey here on GitHub.  

## What to Expect

You'll find me posting repos for each code project I embark on, as there is a lot of stuff I want to do and a lot of languages I want to learn. Hopefully I'll be updating this fairly regularly. 

## What Types of Projects?

Right now, I want to really hone in on learning C#, as I want to work with Unity and VR projects. I also hope to pick up some data analysis skills, so work in Python and R will be dropped here as well once I really pick up on it. I do want to learn C++ as well, so whenever that happens, I'll toss my stuff here as well. In short, I have a lot of interests, and hopefully projects to put those skills to use. 

## Non-Coding Interests? 

When I'm not ruining my eyes staring at a code editor, you'll most likely find me ruining my eyes staring at a YouTube video or a video game. These days you'll also find me painting models of all sizes, from Warhammer to Gunpla, collecting and playing board games, reading fantasy and sci-fi novels, collecting manga, cooking korean dishes, and just trying to do too much at once. 

### What've I cooked most recently? 

Fried walleye. Pretty easy recipe too: hit your fish with some salt and pepper, slice up, dunk in potato starch, fry in oil. Really tasty. :D
